              <h2>Off-Road / Semi Off-Road Policy</h2>
              <p>
                Deluxe Caravans off-road range of caravans have been designed
                and constructed to give added strength and ground clearance for
                limited unsealed road usage. Gas venting regulations and other
                construction restraints limit the effectiveness of these
                caravans against dust and water penetration. Under no
                circumstances should these caravans be exposed to water crossing
                at or above body floor level.
              </p>
              <p>
                We strongly recommend towing at a safe speed according to
                travels conditions with extra care and attention required on
                uneven surfaces. Our off-road caravans are not designed for hard
                impacts or heavy landing or severely rutted roads or tracks.
              </p>
              <p>
                Deluxe Caravans off-road are not designed for use on
                four-wheel-drive only tracks.
              </p>
              <p>
                The following items for off-road caravans are not covered under
                Deluxe Caravans Warranty:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Impact or stone damage to body, chassis, or running gear.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Soiling of fabrics and internal fitments from dust and other
                  airborne substances.

                <li>Water damage due to water crossing.</li>
                <li>
                  Movement or damage caused by dislodgment of appliances and
                  fittings resulting from hard impacts or heavy landing or
                  severely rutted roads or tracks.
                </li>

                Deluxe Caravans include equipment and fitting such as cooking

              <h2>CHECKLIST TO MAINTAIN YOUR CARAVAN</h2>
              <p>
                To make sure that our caravans are safe to use and run on the
                roads, it is essential that we regularly check key components of
                our caravan and practice important routines just like how we
                take care of ourselves, our cars, and our homes. This very
                simple practice can prevent expensive damages or repairs and
                furthermore can extend the life of your caravans and maintain
                quality. To warrant any claims, please ensure the measures
                highlighted below are adhered to carefully and to ensure your
                safety while towing.
              </p>
              <h3>BRAKES AND TIRES</h3>
              <p>
                The running gear of your caravan is a crucial component to be
                consistently checked and it is recommended to be checked at your
                general service center every 10,000km or in 4 months, this
                usually depends on whichever one comes first. The main
                components to look out for in this system are,
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  With your tires check to see if there are any damage or
                  inconsistent signs of wear and tear such as cracks or unusual
                  bulges. Pressure should also be checked and the compliance
                  plate will state the correct pressure at the tire should be
                  maintained. Also, make sure to check the rims for cracks or
                  bundles and then tighten the wheel nuts.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h3>CHECK ALL SEALS</h3>
              <p>
                All external and internal seals should be regularly inspected. A
                seal with the smallest split should not be ignored as over time
                this little opening can cause expensive damage and repairs. It
                is recommended that after giving your caravan a detailed wash
                and clean inspect for any damages as this will help to expose
                areas that are not visible when dust or dirt is present.
              </p>
              <p>
                When a damaged seal is found, we advise that you do not go over
                the area with silicone or any other seals. This can create
                further damage and worsens the problems. If you are not
                experienced with sealing, it is recommended that you take your
                caravan to the nearest repairer.
              </p>
              <p>
                During your routine service for your caravan, you can also
                request a seal condition report. This will give you peace of
                mind to have the caravans checked by an experienced
                professional.
              </p>
              <h3>GAS, ELECTRIC AND WATER</h3>
              <p>
                Routine inspection of the water, electricity, and gas is
                important and this also includes testing the appliances
                connected to these. During testing, we want to ensure that there
                are no leaks and that they are working properly. Such as,
                emptying out water from the water tanks frequently. When it
                comes to inspecting the gas and 240v electricity testing or any
                repairs should be given to a licensed professional. It can be a
                dangerous process if you are doing it yourself.
              </p>
              <h3>RUST AND MOULD</h3>
              <p>
                Rust and mould will be experienced by many caravan owners as it
                is common. It can be an expensive process to restore if action
                is not taken early.
              </p>
              <p>
                Rust occurs when exposed to moisture and some key tips to
                prevent dust are;
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Avoid accumulation of mud or dirt on the exterior and interior
                  of your caravan.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Rust that is built up from the surface should be removed from
                  metal surfaces.
                </li>
                <li>Resurface and peel or chipped paintwork.</li>
                <li>
                  Investing in a caravan cover can prevent build-up; however,
                  make sure to dry out the cover after rain and avoid humidity.
                  When the caravan is not in use, make sure to store the caravan
                  in a dry area.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </div>
            <div className="service-type">
              <h2>WHAT TO DO WHEN IT IS NOT RUNNING?</h2>
              <p>
                It is highly recommended to give your caravan a run when not
                traveling, the damage is greater than not having your caravan
                regularly cleaned. There are certain components that we need to
                keep in mind, such as the suspension, bearings, and axles. These
                components may stiffen over time, and applying grease won't help
                these components to move freely. Another component is the idle
                batteries in your caravan; when they are not in use, it can
                drain the batteries and create permanent damage. New batteries
                can be expensive, and to prevent this, it is advised to plug the
                idle batteries into a battery management charger or system. It
                is also suggested to test your batteries before traveling to
                ensure that they hold a charge.

              <h2>WHAT ARE THE BEST STORAGE OPTIONS FOR YOUR CARAVAN?</h2>
              <p>
                If your RV is used for short trips and is kept in storage for a
                long time, make sure to have a suitable undercover area; this
                can help to enhance the life cycle of your caravan. Furthermore,
                a covered area can help to prevent unnecessary damage such as
                falling dangers, wear and tear, and other dangers. If you do not
                have an undercover area, another great option is a caravan
                cover.

              <h2>HOW CAN I CLAIM WARRANTY?</h2>
              <p>
                Once we receive a claim, the claim will be accessed through
                photos/videos or in-person inspection if required to review the
                validity of the claim.
              </p>
              <p>
                If the claim is valid, we will request a few quotations from a
                service center for further inspection or for the repair to be
                carried out after authorization is given by Deluxe Caravans to
                cover the costs.

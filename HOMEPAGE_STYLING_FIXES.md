# Homepage Styling Issues Fixed ✅

## 🔧 **Issues Identified and Resolved**

### **1. Dark Buttons (Not Glassmorphism)** ❌➡️✅
**Problem**: Buttons appeared too dark and didn't have proper glassmorphism effect
**Solutions Applied**:
- Changed background from `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.7)` to `rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1)`
- Enhanced border from `rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.3)` to `rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.4)`
- Increased backdrop-filter from `blur(10px)` to `blur(15px)`
- Added inset shadow for better glassmorphism: `inset 0 1px 0 rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.2)`
- Improved hover state with better transparency and shadows

### **2. Australian Made Banner Clipped/Not Visible** ❌➡️✅
**Problem**: Banner was positioned incorrectly and getting clipped
**Solutions Applied**:
- Changed positioning from `top: 90%` to `bottom: 10%`
- Removed problematic `transform: translateY(-50%)`
- Increased z-index from `3` to `10` for better layering
- Enhanced backdrop-filter for better visibility
- Fixed mobile positioning to be centered
- Changed video container overflow from `hidden` to `visible`

### **3. Component Black Backgrounds Don't Match** ❌➡️✅
**Problem**: Each component had heavy black gradients that looked inconsistent
**Solutions Applied**:
- Simplified main component background to use `var(--primary-bg)` only
- Made alternating components more subtle with light gradient overlay
- Removed heavy backdrop-filter effects
- Maintained consistent theme while reducing visual noise
